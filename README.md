# DynamicObjects

## Purpose of this package

This Package's purpose is to bring Objects to Julia that can dynamically modify or add fields, as is standart in many other modern high level languages. In Julia, once a struct or NamedTuple is defined, it is impossible to add new fields to its instances. This package mainly introduces the `DynamicObject` type, for which this is possible.


Even though this is quite a small package, this is still work in progress, so use with caution.
